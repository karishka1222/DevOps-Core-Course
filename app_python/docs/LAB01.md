# Lab 01 - DevOps Info Service

## 1. Framework Selection

### Chosen Framework: Flask 3.1.0

**Decision Rationale:**

I selected Flask as the web framework for this DevOps Info Service based on several key factors:

1. **Simplicity and Minimalism**
   - Flask follows the "micro-framework" philosophy - it provides just what you need
   - No unnecessary complexity for our use case (two simple endpoints)
   - Easy to understand and maintain

2. **Learning Curve**
   - Excellent for beginners and teaching purposes
   - Clear, straightforward syntax
   - Well-documented with extensive community resources

3. **Flexibility**
   - Doesn't impose strict project structure
   - Easy to add extensions as needed (future labs)
   - Perfect for microservices architecture

4. **Production-Ready**
   - Mature framework (since 2010)
   - Used by major companies (Pinterest, LinkedIn, Netflix)
   - Stable and well-tested

### Framework Comparison

| Feature | Flask | FastAPI | Django |
|---------|-------|---------|--------|
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Learning Curve** | Easy | Medium | Steep |
| **Performance** | Good | Excellent (async) | Good |
| **Documentation** | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Built-in Features** | Minimal | API-focused | Full-stack |
| **Async Support** | Limited | Native | Limited |
| **Best For** | Simple APIs, Prototypes | Modern APIs, High performance | Full applications, Admin panels |
| **Our Use Case** | Perfect | Good | Overkill |

### Why Not FastAPI or Django?

**FastAPI:**
- Excellent choice, but async features are unnecessary for our simple info service
- Auto-generated documentation is nice but not required
- Would be ideal for high-performance APIs with many concurrent requests

**Django:**
- Too heavyweight for our needs
- Includes ORM, admin panel, templating - features we don't need
- Better suited for full web applications with databases and user management

### Conclusion

Flask is the optimal choice for Lab 01 because it provides exactly what we need: a simple way to create REST endpoints with JSON responses, without unnecessary complexity. As we progress through the labs, Flask's extensibility will allow us to add features incrementally.

## 2. Best Practices Applied

### 2.1 Code Organization and Structure

**Practice: Modular Function Design**

```python
def get_system_info():
    """Collect comprehensive system information."""
    return {
        'hostname': socket.gethostname(),
        'platform': platform.system(),
        # ...
    }
```

**Why it matters:**
- Separates concerns: each function has one clear purpose
- Makes code testable (we can test `get_system_info()` independently)
- Easy to modify or extend without touching route handlers
- Improves code readability

### 2.2 Documentation

**Practice: Comprehensive Docstrings**

```python
def get_uptime():
    """Calculate application uptime since start."""
```

**Why it matters:**
- Self-documenting code reduces need for external documentation
- Helps IDEs provide better autocomplete and hints
- Essential for team collaboration
- Future you will thank present you

### 2.3 Error Handling

**Practice: Custom Error Handlers**

```python
@app.errorhandler(404)
def not_found(error):
    """Handle 404 errors with JSON response."""
    return jsonify({
        'error': 'Not Found',
        'message': 'Endpoint does not exist',
        'path': request.path
    }), 404
```

**Why it matters:**
- Consistent error responses across the API
- Better debugging with contextual information
- Client applications can handle errors programmatically
- Professional API behavior

### 2.4 Logging

**Practice: Structured Logging**

```python
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.info(f'Request: {request.method} {request.path} from {request.remote_addr}')
```

**Why it matters:**
- Essential for production debugging
- Helps track user behavior and system issues
- Different log levels allow filtering (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR)
- Timestamps help with troubleshooting

### 2.5 Configuration Management

**Practice: Environment Variables**

```python
HOST = os.getenv('HOST', '0.0.0.0')
PORT = int(os.getenv('PORT', 5000))
DEBUG = os.getenv('DEBUG', 'False').lower() == 'true'
```

**Why it matters:**
- Different configurations for dev/staging/production
- Security: sensitive data not hardcoded
- Easy deployment to different environments
- Follows 12-factor app methodology

### 2.6 PEP 8 Compliance

**Practice: Python Style Guide**

- 4-space indentation (not tabs)
- Maximum line length: 79 characters for code
- Clear naming conventions: `get_system_info()` not `getSysInfo()`
- Blank lines separate logical sections

**Why it matters:**
- Consistent code style across Python projects
- Easier collaboration with other developers
- Readable by anyone familiar with Python
- Professional standard

### 2.7 Dependency Management

**Practice: Pinned Versions in requirements.txt**

```txt
Flask==3.1.0
Werkzeug==3.1.3
requests==2.32.3
```

**Why it matters:**
- Reproducible builds: same code works everywhere
- Prevents breaking changes from automatic updates
- Easy to audit security vulnerabilities
- CI/CD systems can cache exact versions

## 5. Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Uptime Calculation

**Problem:**
Initially, uptime was calculated as total seconds only, which is hard to read (e.g., 7325 seconds).

**Solution:**
Implemented `get_uptime()` function that returns both:
- `uptime_seconds`: 7325 (for programmatic use)
- `uptime_human`: "2 hours, 2 minutes" (for human readability)

**Code:**
```python
def get_uptime():
    delta = datetime.now(timezone.utc) - START_TIME
    seconds = int(delta.total_seconds())
    hours = seconds // 3600
    minutes = (seconds % 3600) // 60
    
    if hours > 0:
        human = f"{hours} hour{'s' if hours != 1 else ''}, {minutes} minute{'s' if minutes != 1 else ''}"
    elif minutes > 0:
        human = f"{minutes} minute{'s' if minutes != 1 else ''}"
    else:
        human = f"{seconds} second{'s' if seconds != 1 else ''}"
    
    return {'seconds': seconds, 'human': human}
```

### Challenge 2: Timezone Handling

**Problem:**
Python's `datetime.now()` returns timezone-naive datetime, which can cause confusion in distributed systems.

**Solution:**
Always use `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` to get timezone-aware UTC timestamps:

```python
current_time = datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
# Returns: "2026-01-27T12:00:00.000000+00:00"
```

**Why UTC:**
- Standard for server applications
- No daylight saving time confusion
- Easy to convert to local time on client side

### Challenge 3: Error Handling for System Info

**Problem:**
System calls like `socket.gethostname()` could fail in restricted environments.

**Solution:**
Wrapped system info collection in try-except:

```python
def get_system_info():
    try:
        return {
            'hostname': socket.gethostname(),
            # ...
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error getting system info: {e}")
        return {}
```

This ensures the service doesn't crash if a system call fails; it just returns empty system info.
